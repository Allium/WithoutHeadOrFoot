## Me

My name is Cato. I was born in London, UK, where I lived until 2011. In that year I moved to New York City to pursue a PhD in physics. It feels like it will never end.

Anything interesting to point out? Let me know: cato@nyu.edu.

## This blog

Why this blog and what you should expect

For me:

- Practise writing, get into habit, collect feedback
- Share interesting stuff / give myself a reason to think about it
- Evade the crushing certainty that life is meaningless by constructing a tangible Universe where I am at the centre

For you:

* Read interesting stuff
* Snort dismissively at the tepid bollocks that I think is interesting
* Be inspired to write your own blog
* We should all write blogs and read each others' blogs
* Then we don't have to talk to each other any more
