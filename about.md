## Me

My name is Cato. I was born in London, UK, where I lived until 2011. In that year I moved to New York City to pursue a PhD in physics. It feels like it will never end.

Why write a blog?

For me:

- I'd like to get into the habit of writing; physics is wonderful in many ways, but it doesn't naturally nourish a flair for prose.
- I'm into feedback -- of both the writing and the content. Or whatever, talk to me.
  + To this end, I want to include a comments box on the post pages; I just haven't figured it out yet.
- I want to give myself an excuse to spend time thinking about things which are not physics.
- In one way or another, we must all evade the crushing certainty that life is meaningless by constructing a tangible Universe where we are at the centre.

For you:

- You lucky people get to read all of the interesting things I have to say.
  - Perhaps you'll be inspired to write your own blog.
    - We should all write blogs and read each others' blogs.
      - Then we don't have to talk to one another any more.
