*[Parts 3 and 4 of the Roots of Paradigm series will be in the works soon! For now, please indulge a little polemic detour.]*

Oh, how the mighty have done it again. 

This week, a consortium of over 100 Nobel-winning scientists published an open letter denouncing Greenpeace for their ongoing campaign against genetically modified (GM) crops.

My own reactions upon reading the letter were mixed. On one hand, I generally support Greenpeace; I applaud their provocative research and their attitude to direct action. On the other hand, I don't agree with them on everything and I sometimes find their shrill dogmatism on certain issues (and this one in particular) rather frustrating.

On the third hand, this Nobel letter (the full text of which can be found [here](http://supportprecisionagriculture.org/nobel-laureate-gmo-letter_rjr.html)) is disappointingly simplistic and narrow, and addresses only the weakest element of Greenpeace's position. Far from representing a good-faith invigoration of the stagnant public debate, or an attempt to actually help the public understand the problems and benefits of GM agriculture, these great minds invoked the name of science merely to reinforce focus on sickly red herrings. 

Clearly these scientists are more concerned with bullshit appearances than with the substance of humanity's future. As a scientist myself, I expected better.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->

### The Letter

At the time of writing, the letter had been signed by 110 Nobel laureates. It's very short, and I recommend taking a look for yourself. But the main thrust is that Greenpeace's opposition to GM agriculture is founded on an unscientific and absolutist ideology.

> We urge Greenpeace and its supporters to re-examine the experience of farmers and consumers worldwide with crops and foods improved through biotechnology, recognize the findings of authoritative scientific bodies and regulatory agencies, and abandon their campaign against GM crops in general and Golden Rice in particular.

The Golden Rice of which they speak has been a sticking point in this debate for as long as I can remember (which is about 11 years). Golden Rice is an umbrella term for rice which has been genetically engineered to produce high quantities of beta-carotene (and related nutrients), which is a precursor to vitamin A. It is often touted as a way to combat the scourge of vitamin A deficiency (VAD) in the developing world. From the letter:

> The World Health Organization estimates that 250 million people, suffer from VAD, including 40 percent of children under five in the developing world. ... VAD itself is the leading cause of childhood blindness globally affecting 250,000-500,000 children each year. Half die within 12 months of losing their eyesight.

A number of labs have been working on Golden Rice for a couple of decades now. I believe the most promising strains to date have been developed by the biotechnology and agrichemicals giant Syngenta.

<!-- ====================================================================== -->

### Health and Emotion

What is Greenpeace's problem with GM crops and Golden Rice? The Nobel laureates highlight a single contention, which is nevertheless the most prominent in the wider public debate: namely that they may pose danger to human health (and to the health of other organisms). The letter asserts that this concern has scant grounding:
	
> There has never been a single confirmed case of a negative health outcome for humans or animals from consumption of GM foods.

Though no references to any research studies are provided, I believe the scientific case for this claim is sound. 
New varieties of crops, and particularly GM varieties, must undergo a thorough vetting process before they're even approved for field trials (ironically these safeguards are in place largely thanks to the activism of organisations like Greenpeace). To obtain commercial licences, GM crops must pass batteries of chemical and genetic tests; their effect on individual cells from a variety of organisms must be assessed; and their consumption by test-groups of animals and finally humans must deomstrate that they are safe.

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

The letter's implications are clear: Greenpeace is scientifically dishonest in their portrayal of GM crops as hazardous.
<!-- Greenpeace would of course contest this, and the argument then follows its by now tedious course. Let me skip over it and make a more general point. As I admitted already, -->
Indeed, Greenpeace are frequently accused of alarmism, and of using the spectre of poisonous "frankenfood" to foment irrational fears in the population. But this is also a caricature, an image partially crafted and perpetually reinforced by pro-GM groups to facilitate the dismissal of activists as irrational luddites, and avoid having to engage with their arguments.

This letter falls right into that trap: in accusing Greenpeace of distracting the public with unsubstantiated, emotive rhetoric, the luminaries of science indulge in precisely the same tactics. They attack Greenpeace without critically engaging with their more complex arguments. They invoke GM agriculture as a vague panacea for a terrible and heartbreaking disease, without addressing the material realities of its deployment. I feel the calibre of this discussion is unbefitting of the calibre of the minds behind it.

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

But the underlying problem with this letter is not that the scientists are being "unscientific" in their delivery, but that *the scientists believe that this is an issue of science alone*. They believe that Greenpeace's dismissal of the scientific case for GM agriculture makes them not only wrong, but exposes them as uninterested in the truth or justice of the matter.

I disagree with this view; I claim that, at least for now, the problems posed by GM agriculture are no longer issues of natural science. And I further hold that if this is all the scientists can see, it is a troubling indictment of their arrogance and myopia.

### Technology Development

Conspicuously absent from the letter, for instance, is any mention the *producers* of GM seeds. From the letter alone, you'd be forgiven for thinking the technology is a universal gem of our collective intellectual treasury. But that is not the case: those who produce commercial GM technology are transnational corporations like Syngenta and Monsanto, who hold patents on the organisms' genomes. They are not philanthropists, they are out to make profit like any other company.

		<p>
		Most would agree that Greenpeace's tactics are aggressive. Some may even call them bullies &ndash; but a look at who they are bullying might dispel one's sympathy them. In an arena where the combatants have such mismatched power and resources, it's highly impressive that Greenpeace is such an effective campaigner.
		<p>
		<br>
		</p>
		One of the things we can really thank Greenpeace for is dragging issues out into the open. Centralised power often benefits from  public invisibility (e.g. who has heard of Serco?) &ndash; it's much easier to operate if your activities won't be questioned, criticised or regulated, and a good way to achieve that is if nobody knows you exist. I reckon Greenpeace does a fine job of refusing them that luxury.

	</div>
</div>
<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

I don't mean to suggest that commercial interests necessarily preclude work for the good of the public and humanity at large; but merely that we must be wary of the sophisticated craft of public image and spin.

Take Golden Rice, whose humanitarian credentials have been enthusiatically touted for years, but which has to date witnessed no substantial deployment. Nor is there convincing evidence that it is a cost-effective &ndash; or even actually effective &ndash; means of mitigating VAD in at-risk populations.

It's a similar story for the other GM crops with traits like drought or salt tolerance, which are allegedly there to help poor farmers. They comprise a high percentage of agritech public relations content, a near-zero percentage of research investment, and a zero percentage of seed sales.

### The Successes of GM Crops

So what *is* GM technology good for, if not improving nutrition or helping farmers cope with adverse local conditions? Looking at the portfolio of crops available on the market, the simple answer is agricultural industrialisation &ndash; promoting conglomeration and commercialisation of farms, and allowing them to be run by fewer people.

For example, the majority of GM crops under cultivation are engineered to be resistant to a broad-spectrum weedkiller/herbicide called glyphosate (a ban of which was recently suspended by the EU). The thinking is that once a farmer has bought GM seeds, they can also buy that company's glyphosate preparation (e.g. Monsanto's RoundUp) and apply it to their fields in quantities that would damage or kill non-GM varieties of the crop.

The resulting generous and mechanised use of these chemicals, and the concomitant devotion of large tracts to a single variety of crop (monoculture), is unfortunately known to destroy local ecosystems and contaminates bodies of water (both over and under ground). Repeated use may reduce the capacity of non-GM crops to grow on the field, locking farmers into a cycle of loyalty to certain GM products. 

Herbicides like glyphosate have further been found to negatively disrupt soil microbiology, poison nitrogen fixing bacteria, promote colonisation by fungal pathogens and undermine crops' natural disease immunity. And all these negative effects demand the application of yet more chemicals like artificial fertilisers and pesticides, placing yet more stresses on soil ecology.
(Agritech companies still claims that GM crops reduce herbicide use; this is both ludicrous and demonstrably untrue.)

Yet even this uncomfortable arrangement can't last: the list of weeds which have developed resistance to glyphosate is long and growing. Farmers resorting to other, more potent herbicides then exacerbates the environmental degradations just discussed. Moreover, the unintended (though entirely foreseeable) emergence of battle-hardened, resistant weeds pose severe threat to conventionally-bred crops (which cannot be doused in herbicide), and even to wild ecosystems.

So, say I am a struggling farmer who needs to increase productivity and adopts GM crops. There'll probably be a period of higher, less variable yield after the transition, which is great; but in a matter of years the benefits begin to disappear, until I am once more a struggling farmer &ndash; except now my crop diversity, farm labour, autonomy, and soil health have all been sacrificed, my weedkillers are more toxic, I've trashed the surrounding environment, and my neighbours are all dealing with herbicide-resistant weeds.

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

There are other categories of crop (e.g. ones which produce pesticides), and several broader questions which need to be addressed (e.g. gene transfer) to get a full understanding of the scientific debate around GM agriculture. It's unnecessary for my purposes to go into them here; but I hope the foregoing discussion of agritech has illustrated to some degree that GM can introduce as many problems as it solves, and moreover encourages a form of agriculture that is deeply non-ecological in approach.

In light of the above and what is yet to come, I argue that the promotion of Golden Rice is nothing but a publicity stunt designed to engender acceptance of GM agriculture in both the developed and the developing world. The likes of Syngenta construe their distribution of Golden Rice in poor countries as a humanitarian action; but it can equally be seen as a cynical penetration of these emerging markets. (Indeed, I see clear parallels with Nestl&eacute;'s actions which led to the infant formula scandal of the 1980s.)

<!-- ====================================================================== -->

### Control of Productive Land

If you're thinking that I'm being unfair to the other side of the argument, I tell you they deserve it. No, I accept the criticism. But remember my main purpose was to counterbalance and to illustrate the superficiality of the Nobel laureates' open letter. Unfortunately, I'm not qualified to find the absolute truth of an issue which, owing to the vast sums of money and political influence involved, is rife with misinformation and misappropriation of research.

Anyway, as it stands my underlying point is that the Nobel scientists are blinded by their scientific absolutism. From their letter, it would appear they believe that "science" stops at genetic engineering and molecular biology; but as we have seen, there are important considerations from the fields of ecology and genetic adaption.

Now I'd like to further broaden this intellectual tableau to include elements of social science &ndash; for if we are interested in helping *humans*, rather than "simply" understanding the natural world, some perspective on human institutions like economics, business, intellectual property, and sociology is indispensable. It is only with a human-oriented approach that we can ask the crucial question of who should control agricultural production.

Because the fact is that practicable alternatives to GM agriculture exist, ones which deliver autonomy and ownership to farmers, rather than ceding it to corporate interests. I cannot stress enough how troubling it is that control over the global food system is increasingly concentrated in the hands of a few dozen agritech and supermarket giants which, having reached limits to their power over the wealthy countries of their birth, now seek to extend their influence over poor countries who can offer little resistance to the Western capitalist juggernaut (and whose populations may be unable to effectively regulate transnationals).

A food system that prioritises Western shareholders over the feeding and resilience of people, that puts the demands of capital before the livelihoods of small farmers, the integrity of communities and local markets, and stewardship of the environment, is nothing to be proud of. It benefits neither the producers alienated from their land and their traditions, nor consumers alienated from food itself.

I'm not saying that any intervention by the institutions of wealthy countries in the affairs of the global poor is bound to disadvantage the latter. Nor do I believe that self-interest is categorically wrong. But the agritech companies have all the cards, and farmers are being tricked into ceding their assets, their self-determination, and potentially the health of their environment and families, for the benefit of the rich &ndash; a pattern of affairs which, while all too familiar, is difficult to reverse. This is unacceptable. Farmers in poor countries deserve executive ownership of their food system.

<!-- ====================================================================== -->

### What are the Alternatives?

Though nothing in global agriculture is simple, the problems which genetic modification seeks to address have a variety of solutions which are less corporate, less technologically intensive, more empowering, and much *much* cheaper.
Traditional farming practices such as crop rotation, crop diversification, and soil management can all deliver substantial yield increases, improve nutrition, and control pests for a fraction of the cost. These techniques protect the resilience of the soil rather than degrading it, and relieve some of the reliance on imported fertilisers and pesticides.

Soil health in particular has been severely hit by excessive use of such agrichemicals, and by an emphasis on industrial monocultures. Furthermore, it is the lack of diversity in crops and crop varieties which has contributed most to the impoverished diets of the global poor.

This brings us back to Golden Rice, which, deeply tied to the industrial resource-intensive monoculture model of agriculture, may only be excerbating the underlying problem of crop and diet diversity. I find it shameful that the scientists who signed the open letter have been duped into the West's collective obsession with hi-tech neoliberal solutions, when there are plentiful farmer-oriented alternatives for combating vitamin A deficiency. For instance, green vegetables and even other (established, non-patented) variteites of rice which would grow well in regions where VAD is acute contain abundant vitamin A. We should be putting money into schemes to sustainably help poor rural farmers, rather than pouring it into making them dependent on unsustainable, resource-intensive, corporate solutions.

Thus the focus must be on helping poor farmers to diversify their subsistence crops. Perhaps this means access to information and training in sustainable farming practices (which may have been lost during industralisation); perhaps it means improving weather forecasts and access to markets; perhaps it means access to capital to invest in local infrastructure; but it almost certainly means securing land rights and decision-making power over what to grow and how. Indeed, many small-scale farmers in developed countries would benefit from similar innovations. Of course, none of this is profitable for agribusiness, who have been known to invest in monopolising agricultural information in rural areas.

In presenting GM technology as the only option, the Nobel laureates reinforce the story that agritech companies want us to hear. But it is neither the only option, nor even the best option. Unfortunately it is an easy option for us in the developed world, as we profit from our institutions' predations while dismissing our responsibility for / remaining carefully ignorant of their actions far from home.

Now, there may come a day when GM crop science is advanced enough to deliver tangible benefits that outweigh the foreseeable costs. It may be that governmental or philanthropic labs begin to compete with commercial ones in development and productive capacity. I cannot predict what the state of biotechnology and global agriculture will be thirty years from now, and I don't rule GM out of our agricultural future. But there are far more pressing concerns about our agricultural present, and any decision to further reliquish control and responsibility for food systems must not be made lightly. 
	
<!-- ====================================================================== -->

### Broader Patterns

Of course, some of these latter remarks apply beyond agribusiness (in a future post, I intend to discuss a relevant issue with finance institutions). But one my credibly claim that nowhere are such patterns of more immediate consequence than where they impact on food, hunger and nutrition.

And though my take has inevitably been simplistic, I'm pleased that in one day's writing I have done a more thorough job than 110 Nobel laureates. Whether their letter's shortcomings were down to ignorance or disingenuousness (and in this case I don't know which is worse).

This goes to show that eminent scientists, even those who proclaim that science is primarily a process of knowledge acquisition rather than a body of established fact, may still end up conflating the two. In seeing only the idealised "scientific case" for GM agriculture, while failing to apply their critical faculties to the wider issues of social institutions and human wellbeing, they reveal a disappointingly weak grasp of reality.
