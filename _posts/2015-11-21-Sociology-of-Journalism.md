- Olivia: analytics of time spent on each page etc
- Easy to speculate as I did that this has an adverse effect on how journalism is done.
- Before, journalists had a deluded or ideological idea of what people want. Cannot hide from that now.
- People's choices depends of course on editorial decisions: prominent stories are more clicked.
- But take Beirut attack -- [article](http://www.vox.com/2015/11/16/9744640/paris-beirut-media) -- promoting an article might not always help.
- Bring this up because it may plausibly lead to a narrowing of focus in journalism.
- Newspapers and other media outlets are by and large businesses, trying to stay afloat in a competetive environment. Can't waste time on articles which no-one reads. Not worth it for the journalist or company.

- Yet media also has some duty to inform the people, and provide breadth of news, not just the tiny Venn intersection. To promote unknown important issues, to keep the public enfranchised.
- They have mission statements about what kind of news they cover and what angles they take. How can this be balanced with the economic pressures?
- And what are the pressures on writers themselves?
- Luckily I can answer this because I asked Olivia...


- Wealth distortion...
