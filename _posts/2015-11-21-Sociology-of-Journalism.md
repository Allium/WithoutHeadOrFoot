An old schoolfriend recently moved to New York City and is working as a journalist at the online news outlet Quartz (her publications are listed [here](http://qz.com/author/ogoldhillqz/)). Unfortunately for her, I have lots of naive questions about her profession; and fortunately for me she's my friend and has to answer them without getting too irritated. Here are two examples.

#### 1. Wealth and class bias in all professions including journalism

Here is my premise. There are many professions for which the barriers to entry are high: perhaps there are many people vying for few jobs so the market is risky; perhaps they require a large investment of time or money; or perhaps it's assumed that applicants for positions must first learn the ropes through months (or years!) of unpaid inernships. All these forces will tend to exclude people from poorer backgrounds. It is so much easier to pursue jobs which offer risk, delayed returns or low intial pay if you have a financial safety net from family or partners or personal savings.

It would be interesting to see data on the variation of economic background by profession. Such studies certainly exist; without reading them, though, I'd predict that law and medicine are dominated more than any other sector by the upper-middle class. (In the USA, entry to those fields requires additional, very expensive degrees. In the UK the situation isn't so extreme, but the timelag between starting professional training and getting paid for working is still larger than in other professions.)

But regardless of the numbers, there are a few areas where I'd expect the societal effects of bias to have the most important ramifications: personal lawyers, legislators, and journalists. All of these are tasked to some extent with protecting and educating the public despite the prevailing power structures which frequently marginalise minorities and the poor. It is especially important to have experienced advocates for the unenfrachised in the areas where they stand to lose the most.

Turning now to journalism specifically: these days job applications are often considered only after a good deal of unpaid labour, so from the foregoing reasoning we might expect journalists to be predominantly middle-class. Of course this doesn't mean that they only serve the middle class -- there is a huge variety in both what is written and the in the audiences it is written for. I'm merely suggesting that non-representative perspectives may become standard, entailing certain expectations about and attitudes towards society, and  tacit embedded assumptions about how the world works.

To rephrase this a little more explicitly, whatever the objectives and culture of the publication in question, if mid-to-upper-middle-class writers and editors dominate the landscape, this will affect what gets written. Contrast this with a scenario where there are working-class journalists writing for middle-class readers, and also working-class journalists writing for working-class readers -- I imagine the tone and approach and even content of those articles would be different on the whole. If everything is written from a position of privilege, the
corpus is consequently written from a position of ignorance.

An analogy. Imagine that, by chance, journalists were overwhelmingly male. Of couse they would still publish material for women to read; and much of it would be very good by all standards. I can't help feeling, however, that something would be lost.

So far, that's all this is: feeling and speculation. I e-mailed my journalist friend about it and she came back with some interesting comments (edited and shuffled slightly for clarity).

> What you've been talking about has definitely become an issue
in the UK -- it's become far more "private school" this generation. People are angry about all the unpaid internships and
nepotism because previously it wasn't like that at
all and was very diverse. Indeed, many of the very best journalists had no university
education and a working class background (e.g. Harold Evans, Rebekah Brooks).
> 
> In the US it's worse on the whole; for example most journalists have been to
university. But within my publication Quartz there's a major focus on
diversity, so it's hard for me to judge.
>
> Of course the demographics of writers affects what's written and is an issue.
But I think this pales in comparison to how the demographics of
readers affects what's written.

Conclusion: yes there is a bias of backgrounds withing the profession, but in her estimation there isn't much evidence that it distorts the news. I'm making a storm in a teacup.

I find her answer comforting: she's a smart and self-aware lass and more clued-in than I am when it comes to workplace sociology (indeed, when it comes to most things). However, the issue of diversity and access to different professions clearly has much broader social justice ramifications than the one I've been addressing, and these are still at large. I only have to look around my physics department to see that, yes, we have a problem with gender balance.

#### 2. Reader-driven focus

- Olivia: analytics of time spent on each page etc
- Easy to speculate as I did that this has an adverse effect on how journalism is done.
- Before, journalists had a deluded or ideological idea of what people want. Cannot hide from that now.
- People's choices depends of course on editorial decisions: prominent stories are more clicked.
- But take Beirut attack -- [article](http://www.vox.com/2015/11/16/9744640/paris-beirut-media) -- promoting an article might not always help.
- Bring this up because it may plausibly lead to a narrowing of focus in journalism.
- Newspapers and other media outlets are by and large businesses, trying to stay afloat in a competetive environment. Can't waste time on articles which no-one reads. Not worth it for the journalist or company.

- Yet media also has some duty to inform the people, and provide breadth of news, not just the tiny Venn intersection. To promote unknown important issues, to keep the public enfranchised.
- They have mission statements about what kind of news they cover and what angles they take. How can this be balanced with the economic pressures?
- And what are the pressures on writers themselves?
- Luckily I can answer this because I asked Olivia...
