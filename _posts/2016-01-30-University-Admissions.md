### An Educated Population


The question that invariably crops up whenever a government meddles with university and student financing, is "What's the use of educating all these people in the first place?". Well, the table below -- I reckon column 27 is the one to look at -- reveals that affluent countries find great advantages in having an educated population.

Whether these countries are affluent because they are educated or the other way around (or both) doesn't really matter right now: the point is they're prepared to spend [between 1% and 2% of their GDP](http://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator_cmd.asp) putting a significant proportion of their young people through university at least once.

Who benefits from this? Potentially everyone. Businesses get to employ skilled workers, which feeds back into creating advanced employment opportunities. The economy grows, incomes grow, tax revenues grow. Young people can revel in the exploration of their passions, and in the development of new ones. 
Society's stakeholders can revel in an institutionalised population which is (at least in the UK and USA) so saddled with debt that they're guaranteed to be working productively, desperately, for years and even decades to come.


<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

### Unequal Access

But if we take the position that an individual benefits both peronally and professionally from holding a degree, we should also take the (banal) position that *one's access to education should not be predicated on some accident of birth* -- on neither socio-economic class,  gender, nor race. In the words of the UN's [International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights](http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CESCR.aspx) (Article 13.1),

> The Parties ... recognize the right of everyone to education. They agree that education shall be directed to the full development of the human personality and the sense of its dignity, and shall strengthen the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. They further agree that education shall enable all persons to participate effectively in a free society, promote understanding, tolerance, friendship and peace among all nations and all racial, ethnic or religious groups.

Our apparent societal failure to achieve these ideals of inclusivity is a grave indictment. In this post, I wish to present some of the academic findings on racial and socio-economic (and gender) discrimination in higher education. Of course, it's only by understanding what the problems are that we can begin to address them.


<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

### Racial and Ethnic Minorities

An obvious way to expose potential discrimination against ethnic minorities at university is simply to look at the composition of the student body. Finding that the proportion of minorities to be much lower, or indeed much higher, than expected from the same age segment in the general population, would suggest that something is amiss.

And on this premise, something is clearly amiss: there is widespread conviction that some minority groups are under-represented in higher education, both as students and as [teachers](http://blackbritishacademics.co.uk/2014/03/12/why-isnt-my-professor-black/). This can be partially attributed to [exam results](http://www.runnymedetrust.org/uploads/Parliamentary%20briefings/EducationWHdebateJune2012.pdf) -- white students in the UK tend to get better qualifications than their Carribean, Pakistani or Roma classmates (though it should be noted that this situation seems to be improving).

#### Bias in Admissions

Assuming you'll allow me to skirt the issue of why our society has been failing particularly badly in the education of some ethnic minorities, we can look at the slighly simpler problem of institutional bias within universities which is perhaps not predicated on indicators of merit (like exam results), but on implicit racism of the admissions people. This microcosm of societal attitudes is no less sinister, but it is conceivably easier to deal with. There have been many studies which "control" for exam grades -- they group candidates not just by race but also by A-levels, and see whether there is bias within the category of ostensibly identical candidates. A recent example comes from LSE's 2014 report [Black and Minority Ethnic Access to Higher Education](http://www.lse.ac.uk/newsAndMedia/news/archives/2014/07/BMEStudentsLessLikelyToReceiveOffersFromUniversity.aspx) which found, according to co-author Dr M. Shiner,

> Even when we take account of A-level grades, candidates' chances of receiving an offer vary according to their ethnicity, the type of school they attend and their family background. For some candidates these factors combine to create quite marked differences.

This is damning indeed, if not unexpected. The investigation found, for instance, that while over 70% of white university applicants were offered a place, for Bangladeshi and Pakistani students the figure was close to 50%.

Some do seem to challenge the results -- for example, [this BBC article](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/education/8493894.stm) reports that 'ethnic minority groups are better represented in UK universities than in the general population'. I don't know enough about the respective methodologies to judge which is correct; but my money's on the first one.

#### Behavioural Factors

Yet, with all studies which collect population data and then split it up according to this or that factor, there's always the possibility that you've missed a vital control. The Russell Group (a consortium of the UK's most prestigious universities) and the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS) claim that two important behavioural effects have been overlooked in analyses of the data. The first is that some of the alleged bias in admission / offer rates is down to the fact that students from minority backgrounds whose results are comparable to a white student nevertheless are slightly more likely to have studied less impressive / academic subjects: tourism rather than maths, say. The second is that minority students are more likely to choose the most oversubscribed and competetive courses, and hence are less likely to get in than their less ambitious white classmates. [According to UCAS](https://www.ucas.com/sites/default/files/gbanalysis_note_2015_05_web_0.pdf)),

> The ‘expected’ offer rate to Asian, Black, Mixed and Other applicants is lower than to White applicants. This reflects that (for the same strength of predicted grades) Asian, Black, Mixed and Other applicants are more likely to apply to [more prestigious] universities and courses that have lower offer rates. Most of the difference in offer rates between ethnic groups is accounted for by these different application patterns.
<!-- [UCAS Analysis Note 2015/05](https://www.ucas.com/corporate/news-and-key-documents/news/ucas-analysis-note-201505-%E2%80%93-offer-rates-different-ethnic) -->

This point is broadly consistent with two other pieces of evidence: that [educational ambition appears to be higher](http://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/jul/23/white-pupils-university-ethnic-groups) among non-whites; and that non-whites 
tend to achieve worse degree classifications -- according to the [Higher Education Funding Council (2014)](http://www.hefce.ac.uk/pubs/year/2014/201403/#d.en.86821), 72% of white students with BBB A-levels gained a first or upper second, compared with 56% for Asian students and 53% for black students --, since choosing a more taxing course raises the likelihood of poor results.
<!-- - They also have poorer university experiences as students, lower degree results than their A-level grades would predict, and more uncertain graduate job prospects http://www.runnymedetrust.org/uploads/WhenEducationIsntEnough.pdf.  -->

#### Historical Precedent

Furthermore, it isn't the first time such an effect has been witnessed. In the early 1970s, UC Berkeley was taken to court because of apparent discrimination against female applicants for postgraduate courses (offering places to 44% of men but only 35% of women). When statisticians (Bickell, Hammell and O'Connell) carefully analysed the data, however, they came to a similar conclusion as discussed above. The abstract of their paper [Sex Bias in Graduate Admissions: Data from Berkeley](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/187/4175/398) (1975) in the journal Science reads:

> Examination of aggregate data on graduate admissions to the University of California, Berkeley, for fall 1973 shows a clear but misleading pattern of bias against female applicants. Examination of the disaggregated data reveals few university departments show statistically significant departures from expected frequencies of female admissions, and about as many appear to favor women as to favor men. If the data are properly pooled, taking into account ... the tendency of women to apply to graduate departments that are more difficult for applicants of either sex to enter, there is a small but statistically significant bias in favor of women ... The bias in the aggregated data stems not from any pattern of discrimination on the part of admissions committees, which seem quite fair on the whole, but apparently from prior screening at earlier levels of the educational system.

#### Unresolved Dicrepancies

Taking all this at face value, universities are off the hook, and if we want to explore the reasons for discrepancies between men and women, or between whites and non-whites, we're back to grappling with the underlying cultural and historical biases that I took such pains to avoid.

You'll be glad to hear that I shall continue to avoid them. But the isn't over yet, because even once we account for all these behavioural effects, there *still* appears to be statistically significant discrimination. Dr V. Boliver from Durham University in the UK is an outspoken researcher of university admissions policy, and has 'found that offer rates were between seven and 16 percentage points lower for applicants from British ethnic minority backgrounds than for white British applicants, after taking into account their A-level grades and the popularity of the courses applied for.'. From their [2015 Sociology paper(http://soc.sagepub.com/content/early/2015/05/12/0038038515575859.abstract):

> Contrary to received opinion, the greater tendency of ethnic minorities to choose highly competitive degree subjects only partially accounts for their lower offer rates from Russell Group universities relative to white applicants with the same grades and ‘facilitating subjects’ at A-level.


#### Clearer Indicator

If we have learned nothing else from the foregoing discussion, it's that studies on population data are fraught with possible oversights. Thankfully, in the case of ethnicity-sensitive research, there's a slightly cleaner (if more limited) research method available: one can investigate implicit biases predicated on ethnicity, by submitting identical university or job applications under different names.

A seminal work along these lines was the 2004 paper "Are Emily and Greg More Employable than Lakisha and Jamal?", authored by M. Bertrand (University of Chicago) and S. Mullainathan (MIT) and published in American Economic Review (I was unable to find any UK studies, but I expect the US and UK are similar enough for the results to be applicable). A more recent study by K. Milkman (University of Pennsylvania), D. Chugh (New York University) and M. Akinola (Columbia) focussed specifically on university departments. From the abstract of [their 2015 paper](https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/apl-0000022.pdf)

> In our experiment, 6500 professors were contacted by fictional prospective students seeking to discuss research opportunities prior to applying to a doctoral program. Names of students were randomly assigned to signal gender and race (White, Black, Hispanic, Indian, Chinese), but messages were otherwise identical ... We found that faculty were significantly more responsive to White males than to all other categories of students, collectively, particularly in higher-paying disciplines and private institutions.

Their analysis was quite detailed, but here's an easily digestible graphic from their paper (beware easily digestible anything -- it's likely to be misleading. Really one should look at their data where they cross-correlate response rate with ethnic / sex make-up of the professors contacted and the departments as a whole, and a bunch of other stuff):

<!-- Science faculty favour male job applicants http://www.pnas.org/content/109/41/16474.abstract. -->

Indeed, these kinds of studies typically agree with Dr Boliver's findings quoted above: discrepancies in the treatment of different ethnicities are significant, even when controlling for other factors, and they tend to favour whites.

One easy intervention that could be made, which, to be honest, should have been obvious from the beginning, would be to require all university applications, job applications, [article submissions to academic journals](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/mckinley/notes/snodgrass-sigmod-2006.pdf), legal documents and the like to be [anonymised](https://theconversation.com/will-name-blind-ucas-forms-make-university-admissions-fairer-49822) so that it's impossible to directly ascertain the person's ethnicity or gender.

### Socio-economic Background

- Harder to pin down -- can't have a poor-sounding name. But many of the same considerations apply (harder courses etc) partly because there is some correlation between race and wealth.

- https://www.dur.ac.uk/sass/staff/profile/?mode=pdetail&id=9700&sid=9700&pdetail=76705 state / minoriteis and state schools less likely to receive offer. The empirical findings show that access to Russell Group universities is far from fair ... applicants from lower class backgrounds and from state schools remained much less likely to apply to Russell Group universities than their comparably qualified counterparts from higher class backgrounds and private schools, while Russell Group applicants from state schools and from Black and Asian ethnic backgrounds remained much less likely to receive offers of admission from Russell Group universities in comparison with their equivalently qualified peers from private schools and the White ethnic group.


- Just over 7% of British children are privately educated, yet over 40% of those at Oxford and Cambridge were. Because of shoddy state schooling.
- Advantages of private school last beyond university https://theconversation.com/social-mobility-why-does-private-school-give-you-such-a-leg-up-45739 data on pay difference, and self-confidence
- READ https://theconversation.com/gap-between-state-and-private-school-admissions-to-top-unis-due-to-grades-not-bias-30178 state schools failing. Why is another question; don't talk about intrinsic cleverness / social justice yet, just take statistics at face value.
- A problem is if there are other factors limiting on top of the already poor performance. It would be tragic if those who are capable are still being disuaded.

Finance

- discouraging poor families http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/aug/09/student-debt-kick-in-teeth-for-poor-families knock-on effects for birth rate and home ownership. Worse than USA. Britain is in the process of creating the most stratified, least socially mobile, cruelly unfair society in its treatment of the young in the advanced world. Want more certainty of employability. Default rate rises.
- http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CESCR.aspx The UN International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights supports the implementation of free higher education on the basis that higher education should be equally accessible to all. But equal doesn't mean it should be free; can support low-income students in a transparent and secure way: more equitable to charge based on earnings rather than charge everyone.
Article 13.1.c Higher education shall be made equally accessible to all, on the basis of capacity, by every appropriate means, and in particular by the progressive introduction of free education;

### Counteracting Discrimination

- The picture isn't so bleak as one might think. In large swathes of the system there is no apparent discrimination against minorities -- e.g. higher attainment of black and Indian, only at elite universities. And we must loot at how things are changing as well as where they are now. Fastest shrinking group seems to be poor white boys. http://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/jul/23/white-pupils-university-ethnic-groups
