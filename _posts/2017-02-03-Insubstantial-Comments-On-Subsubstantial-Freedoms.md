But there's more. Mill formulated theories which today beat the heart of political liberalism -- the rights of individuals to express dissenting opinions, the primacy of open discussion, the defence of personal lives free as far as possible from state intrusion and societal interference. To many, these ideas are familiar to the point of triviality. They shimmer the soft cultural furnace of ubiquity.

We shall spare some moments to notice them. First let us dabble our toes in the pellucid waters that moisten the shores of tautology: forgiveness means many things, depending on who is forgiving. When the strong forgive, it emphasises their strength. When the weak forgive, it emphasises their inconsequence.

This observation applies too in the international context of nation states; and also governs the internal power dynamics of each state. Yet, especially in the latter more local case, we can only support the stark declamation about forgiveness to a point. Any political or ideological system which continues to reign (or continues to appear to reign) cannot be so obviously weak that its subjects have already deserted it. So we must consider gradations of power; and faced with hard oblivion at one end the asymptote of messianic generosity at the other, we'd do well to remind ourselves that any political system, or any society, may only be tolerant in proportion to its power.

Free speech, therefore, and open dissent, and the protection of minorities, and even the protection of majorities (to the extent these things happen at all), are emblems of tolerance and therefore emblems of power. They are evidence that society is strong enough to withstand its internal agitations, that its belly is hardened to insult. They are evidence that the poultry coop (paltry co-op) of gabblers stamping and scratching in the public view, exerting their minds and exhorting ours, are not really that inconvenient. (Occasionally they'll even lay an egg.)

So there must be something deeper going on -- because how likely is it that the freedom we enjoy would be stable if it were freedom alone? How likely is it that a society which debases itself, which weakens itself with a million seeping cuts called popular liberties, can survive in the face of the alternative? Let's not forget that our political-and economic systems were concocted and imposed by the merchants whose ships and gold and guns allowed them to gather more of the same. Were these geniuses of commerce and influence naive enough to seed their own destruction?

Current evidence would suggest maybe. And if you'll permit me a brief digression it is both comforting and terrible to think that an institution such as mercantilism or free speech might be turned into the instrument of its own demise. Undeniably there's a poetic justice there, and a centurion view on the vacillations of human societies. However, in this case what actually happened was the merchants seeded not their own destruction but their immortality. At least for the time being.

Because the humble institutions of which Mill and others have convinced us can gain traction only when broader systems of governance are sufficiently established as to be unquestionable. Or, better, invisible. The key ideas (wealth, transaction, labour rental, capitalist modes of production) run deeper than freedom: they are not merely rights to be defended and discussed, but the *language of the discussion itself*. They are the filter of reality, they comprise our social fabric, and hence dominate the way we as a society conceptualise ourselves. Only when a covert tyranny-of-paradigm is firmly enthroned can the literal thrones of existing tyrants be discarded. We call this conditioning of generations progress.

Of course there are limits. Society as an organism will cease to tolerate free speech once the underlying power structures are threatened. Once that line is crossed, the gloves come off. Liberal democracy as we know it is underwritten by the might of fascism, without which its institutions would crumble (replaced most probably by a more full-blooded and honest version of fascism). We see this happening all the time as activist groups dissatisfied with controlled and ineffectual mechanisms of dissent are [terrorised on all fronts](http://catosandford.org/WithoutHeadOrFoot/2016/03/05/Greenlist-Is-The-New-Blacklist.html) by supposedly benevolent governments that supposedly possess the legitimacy to determine which acts and which thoughts count as extremism.

Mill himself was an outspoken colonialist in nineteenth century England, advocating the repression and domination of the militarily (and hence racially and culturally) inferior. In his eyes, the fundamental liberties necessary for justice in human society were to be granted sparingly. Perhaps because free speech would be too dangerous in the hands of cultures which did not yet speak or think in the correct language -- they had not attained the level of civilisation necessary to be blind.

Could it be that those who strained to free society from oppression were still operating within oppression's deeper framework, disguising it as the landscape, fertilising it with the glorious clods of earth they hurled about as they rooted out the kings and lords? Could it be that they turned the oppressed into their own jailers?

	I really, really like the abnormal and loose structure of this post -— very interesting, and much more fluid and fertile than standard linear structures (cf your 'Thinking' fragment). 
	<br>
    <br>
	It also has the feeling of being on the brink of going too far, which David Bowie said was when you know you are on to something. 
	<br>
    <br>
	History: I love the idea of individual change, and actually see change as being a great joy and ideal, and consistency even with your present self, let alone your past, as unnecessarily blinkering.  I remember from a book of his, Bertrand Russell's complaining because he was presupposed as being the same individual Bertrand Russel as he had been 20 years before.  
	<br>
    <br>
	'By indicating how different ages are intelligible only in their own terms, Vico warns against the anachronisms of totalizing interpretations of history.  He thus subordinates history to historiography by showing how the depiction of the past is itself an expression of the values of particular epochs.'  Stephen H Daniel, "Vico’s Historicism and the Ontology of Arguments",  Journal of the History of Philosophy (1995).
	<br>
    <br>
	Teaching: Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny, in the physical development of an individual but also perhaps in the development of an individual identity and the teaching of a discipline.
	<br>
    <br>
	I love the worlds off the plane of the communicable, and the importance of nourishing them.  And it reminds me of Sophie’s dream that she had discovered a new colour, which she saw in her dream. 
	<br>
    <br>
	Sex:  On the sex issue, the Japanese may be responding in a positive way to overcrowding.  I had a hypothesis that the degree of heterosexuality in a society might be a response to plenty, and vice versa.   
	<br>
    <br>
	Silence: counterpoint or syncopation of rhythm with the rest.  I love it.
	<br>
    <br>
	Company: *She* invented suffering?
	<br>
    <br>
	Ideology: Makes me think of Memes, and of Mill’s famous argument for free speech:
	'If all mankind minus one were of one opinion, and only one person were of the contrary opinion, mankind would be no more justified in silencing that one person than he, if he had the power, would be justified in silencing mankind.'
	<br>
    <br>
	Masters: Makes me think of the argument for monarchy -- that you need a nonentity without legitimacy as head of state.  
	<br>
    <br>
	Division: Makes me think of Leonard Cohen -- You become what you resist.  
	<br>
    <br>
	If it was me I might finish the series not on Division but on something more lyrical, but I don’t know why. Maybe because division is a difficult note for the reader to end on.  
	<br>
    <br>
	But in general: really interesting and stirring -- it conveys feeling and thought -- I hope there is more where this came from please.
